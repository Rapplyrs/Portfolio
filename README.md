#Project Title: 

#Portfolio 

#Project Description: 

This is essentially a portfolio for developers to be able to showcase their skills and experiences. This was built using react js, and tailwind css. I used react because of its
component based architecture that allowed me to structure and reusue components in a easier fashion. 

#How to use:

Essentially all you need to do is clone the repo to your desired path location. Adjust the content to allign it with your background. This includes your name, job title, experience, projects,
etc.
